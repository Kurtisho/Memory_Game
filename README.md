# Classic Memory Game

## Synopsis of the game


For this term, I will be designing a memory game in which users will be
displayed cards which have pairs. It is the users task to try and identify 
the respective pairs. In order to **challenge** the users, there will be a
**timer** that tracks the time elapsed for each play through. It is the users
task to try and beat their fastest time!

For instance :

- Play through 1 : 53 Seconds
- Play through 2 : 45 Seconds
- Play through 3 : 42 Seconds
- etc...


## Interests

The reason why I chose to design a memory game was because this was the game
I grew up playing with. My cousins and I loved playing this game because 
we would always challenge each other to see who could have the most 
pairs in a full deck. With this game, we won't be competing to see who has the most pairs but rather
who can achieve the fastest time.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to play the game as long as i'd like
- As a user, I want to be able to see the time spent per game after I quit
- As a user, I want to choose the size of my board and the letters that are in the game
- As a user, I want to rate the difficulty of the game
- As a user, I want to clearly see my previous attempts (keep only for console?)

#  A Challenging Memory Game

## Synopsis of the game

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts. 

For this term, I will be designing a memory game in which users will be
displayed cards which have pairs. It is the users task to try and identify 
the respective pairs. In order to **challenge** the users, there will be 
**variations** of the number of cards that will be shown. 

For instance :

- Level 1 : 8 cards
- Level 2 : 12 cards
- Level 3 : 16 cards
- Level 4 : 22 cards
- etc...

The addition of cards for each level will challenge the user to see just how
much they can remember. To combat the user randomly choosing cards until they
have seen every card, there will be a counter that displays the number of times
a user has incorrectly chosen a card. This will activate when both pairs of 
the card have been seen. If the user has seen the pair of cards, and has 
incorrectly matched said pair 3 times. They will lose the game. Their
objective is to try to obtain the highest level which is TBA. 

## Interests

The reason why I chose to design a memory game was because this was the game
I grew up with. My cousins and I loved playing this game because 
 we would always like to challenge each other to see who could have the most 
pairs in a full deck. Making this game, with my own twist and to have them be
able to play would be exciting. In addition to that, I'd be able to take
their feedback to see how I could make this game even more challenging than
it is currently. We have always debated to see who had the best memory in the 
family so making this game will definitely solve that debate.
